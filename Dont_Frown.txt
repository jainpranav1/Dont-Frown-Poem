Don’t Frown
By Pranav Jain
---------------------------------
If you look in a mirror
And see a big frown.
Take a breath. 
Clear your mind!
Don’t let life get you down.

Go outside.
Look around!
Feel the wind and the sun.
You are here.
You’re alive!
Isn’t that just great fun?

You've got family, teachers
A dog, and two fish.
You've got television 
And at meals, a full dish.

All this said, grab a friend.
Share your troubles with them.
With their help and some time
Happiness will soon stem.
